#Assignment 1 - COMP3133 - Professor: Pritesh Patal
As a newly hired Jr. Software Engineer my manager assigned me a task to 
develop Backend application using NodeJS, Express, GraphQL and 
MongoDB. He also wants me to apply my VCS (GitHub) skills to develop these 
projects where I will commit and push all my code to 
Student#_COMP3133_Assignment1 repository.
